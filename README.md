**Important Note: Current Website Limitations**

Please take note of the following important information regarding the current state of our website:

**Screen Size Limitation**: Our website currently supports screen sizes of 1280px or above. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause for users with smaller screens.

**Partially Implemented Functions**: Please be aware that certain functions, including login, channel creation, private chat messaging, and others, are not fully implemented at this stage. Our website primarily serves as a means to convey the general idea of our project.

We appreciate your understanding and patience as we continue to develop and enhance these features to provide a comprehensive user experience. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out to our support team.


If you would like to test our project in a coding environment please follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repo to your local machine.
2. Open it up using any sort of code editor.(Terminal)
3. Run ``npm i`` to install all the packages required.
4. `npm run dev` to run it on your localhost.
5. Open the site using the link provided in the terminal.

**Important Note: Placeholder for Clickable Components**

Please be aware that certain components within our website are designed to be clickable(hovering over would change the background color), but the corresponding functions they are intended to trigger have not been fully implemented at this time. To indicate their potential future usage, we have added the placeholder **"click_function_not_implemented"** to each HTML tag associated with these components.

We apologize for any inconvenience caused by this temporary limitation and assure you that we are actively working to implement the necessary functionality. Thank you for your understanding and patience as we continue to enhance the user experience.
